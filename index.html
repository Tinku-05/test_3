<h1>Cloud Computing </h1>
<p id="para1">Cloud Computing refers to delivering computing services over the internet ("the cloud").

    Services include storage, databases, servers, networking, software, analytics, and more.
    
    It allows users to access technology services on-demand without owning infrastructure.
    
    Offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.
    
    Major cloud providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    
    Types of Cloud Deployment Models:
    
    Public Cloud: Services offered over the internet by third-party providers.
    
    Private Cloud: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
    
    Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private cloud features.
    
    Community Cloud: Shared among organizations with common concerns.
    
    Service Models:
    
    IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – Provides virtualized computing resources.
    
    PaaS (Platform as a Service) – Provides platform tools for developers.
    
    SaaS (Software as a Service) – Delivers software over the internet.
    
    Examples: IaaS – Amazon EC2, PaaS – Google App Engine, SaaS – Gmail.
    
    Advantages of Cloud Computing:
    
    Cost-effective – Pay-as-you-go model.
    
    Scalable – Resources scale with demand.
    
    Reliable – Offers backup and disaster recovery.
    
    Accessible – Data and applications available anywhere.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    Dependency on internet connectivity.
    
    Limited control over infrastructure.
    
    Data privacy and security risks.
    
    Possible vendor lock-in.
    
    Key Technologies in Cloud Computing:
    
    Virtualization – Enables resource abstraction.
    
    Containers – Lightweight, portable app environments (e.g., Docker).
    
    APIs – Facilitate cloud service integration.
    
    Edge Computing – Brings computing closer to data source.
    
    Cloud Storage – Stores data on remote servers (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
    
    Cloud Security – Includes firewalls, encryption, access controls.
    
    Multi-tenancy – Multiple customers share the same infrastructure securely.
    
    Elasticity – Automatically adjusts resources based on load.
    
    Metered Service – Charges based on usage.
    
    Cloud Management Tools: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, etc.
    
    Service Level Agreement (SLA) – Defines cloud provider's performance guarantees.
    
    Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) – Backup and failover services.
    
    Cloud Migration – Moving data/applications to the cloud.
    
    Cloud Orchestration – Automated management of cloud resources.
    
    Cloud Computing Use Cases:
    
    Web hosting and content delivery.
    
    Big data analytics.
    
    IoT applications.
    
    Machine learning and AI workloads.
    
    Cloud is transforming businesses and IT infrastructure.
    
    Reduces time to market for applications.
    
    Supports remote and hybrid work environments.
    
    Continuously evolving with innovations in AI, quantum computing, etc.
    
    Cloud computing is a backbone of modern digital transformation.
